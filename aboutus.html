      <h1 id="about-head">About Kerala Tourism</h1>
      <p id="about-para">
        Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern
        India, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.
        Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic
        Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and
        beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with
        its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist
        destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism
        industry is a major contributor to the state's economy. Until the early
        1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism
        circuits concentrated around the north of the country. Aggressive
        marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development
        Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the
        state—laid the foundation for the growth of the tourism industry. In the
        decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform itself into
        one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala –
        God's Own Country was adopted in its tourism promotions and became a
        global superbrand. Kerala is regarded as one of the destinations with
        the highest brand recall. In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign
        tourist arrivals. Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as
        well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known for its beaches,
        backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife
        sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the state include the beaches
        at Kovalam, Muzhappilangad, Bekal and Kappad; backwater tourism and lake
        resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at
        Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks
        and wildlife sanctuaries at Wayanad, Periyar, Parambikulam, Silent
        Valley National Park and Eravikulam National Park. The "backwaters"
        region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals
        that centre on Vembanad Lake, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage
        sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry
        Palace, are also visited. To further promote tourism in Kerala, the
        Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala
        in 2007. Since then it has been held every year during the
        December–January period. The state's tourism agenda promotes
        ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture,
        wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local
        population. Efforts are taken to minimize the adverse effects of
        traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural
        integrity of local people. The state has also made deep inroads into
        MICE Tourism mainly centered at Kochi.
