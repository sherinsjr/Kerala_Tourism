        One of the premier trade capitals of the Old World, Kollam is the centre of the country’s cashew trading and
        processing industry. Extolled by Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta in glowing terms, this was once a famous port of
        international spice trade. This historic town is home to the celebrated Ashtamudi Lake, making it a gateway to
        the breath-taking backwaters of Kerala. The eight-hour boat trip between Kollam and Alappuzha is the longest and
        most enchanting experience on the backwaters of Kerala. The momentous decision to introduce a new Malayalam era
        was convened at Kollam and hence the Malayalam calendar came to be known as kollavarsham.
