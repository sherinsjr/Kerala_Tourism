        Thiruvananthapuram (or Trivandrum) is the capital of the southern
        Indian state of Kerala. It's distinguished by its British colonial
        architecture and many art galleries. It’s also home to Kuthira Malika
        (or Puthen Malika) Palace, adorned with carved horses and displaying
        collections related to the Travancore royal family, whose regional
        capital was here from the 18th–20th centuries. <br />
        Though often used as agateway to nearby beach resorts,
        Thiruvananthapuram offers plenty of its own to reward travellers who
        stay. From South Indian cuisine and a sophisticated art scene to
        architectural treasures and historic landmarks, there’s so much to
        experience in Kerala’s capital.
