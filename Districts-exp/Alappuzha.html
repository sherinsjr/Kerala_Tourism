        Affectionately nicknamed the 'Venice of the East' by travellers from across the world, Alappuzha is a district
        of immense natural beauty. Embraced by the Arabian Sea in the west and a network of lakes, lagoons and
        freshwater rivers criss-crossing it, this backwater country is home toa vibrant animal and avian life. By virtue
        of its proximity to the sea, the town has always carved out an exclusive place for itself in the maritime
        history of Kerala. Renowned for its boat races, beaches, marine products and coir industry, the singularity of
        this land is the region called Kuttanad. A land of lush paddy fields referred to as the 'Rice Bowl of Kerala',
        it is one of the few places in the world where farming is done below sea level. This once prosperous trading and
        fishing centre is nowadays a world renowned backwater tourist destination.

              <p class="card-text">
                This particular lake is not only the biggest but also the longest of those that can be found in Kerala.
                When it comes to enjoying backwater tourism in Alappuzha, one of the greatest spots is Vembanad Lake.
                Vembanad lake, located in the middle of Kerala, is surrounded by mangrove and coconut tree forests. The
                Vembanad Lake is the largest lake and the only one that never stops flowing since it is fed by a network
                of smaller lakes that all flow into it at some point. However, the fact that the massive area is so long
                is not what draws travellers to the location in the first place. Throughout the annual Onam festival,
                this lake is the sole venue for the world-famous boat race during the celebration. This is the ideal
                location to spend quality time with your family while enjoying some delicious fresh seafood. Boating on
                Vembanad Lake and spending the night on a houseboat, there is a one-of-a-kind experience that ranks high
                on the list of recommended activities for visitors to the Alappuzha region. This is one of the most
                well-liked places to spend a holiday in all of Kerala.
