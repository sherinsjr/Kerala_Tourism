          A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of
          pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of
          the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut
          groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests. Pathanamthitta has
          been dubbed a Heritage Village as it attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular water
          fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique
          AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village
          which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.
