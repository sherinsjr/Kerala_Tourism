        Kottayam district is famous for its rich heritage and literary tradition. It is renowned for its spice and
        rubber trade. Cradled by the backwaters and the Western Ghats, it is epitomised by its stretches of vast
        greenery, paddy fields and huge rubber plantations. Over five of the State’s leading newspaper publications
        originate from Kottayam. About four-fifth of books published in the State come from here as well. From trekking
        hotbeds like Nadukani and Kottathavalam to the rare avian life on display at the Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, this
        district encompasses everything that God’s Own Country is famous for. Well connected to the entire State, it is
        full of interesting historical and cultural locations that tell the tale of how the district was forged into its
        current form.

                A steep walking track leads to this landmark rock formation, set on a hilltop with panoramic views.
                A trek for 3km from Erattupetta along the steep hilly road takes you to Illikkal Kallu and is the best
                viewpoint destination in the district. Post monsoon season (September to January) is the best time to
                visit this place. During monsoon the paths are slippery so it is risky.
